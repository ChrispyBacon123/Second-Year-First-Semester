# Second-Year-First-Semester
A collection of the assignments that I completed in the first semester of second year.

The assignments were as follows: 

Assignment 1: 
-
A series of SQL queries which demonstrated my knowledge of SQL

Assignment 2:
- 
Assignment 2 was a practical test and thus is not included in this repository

  
Assignment 3:
- 
Assignment 3 was the creation of a hashtable function

Assignment 4:
-
To learn how to use binary trees, I created a program that emulated a social media site called 'TokTik'

Assignment 5:
- 
To learn graph generation, I created a program to carry out an experiment
The aim of this experiment was to compare the practical performance of the Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm
to its theoretical time complexity of O(|E|log|V|) where |E| is the number of edges in the graph, and
|V| is the number of vertices in the graph to determine if these were sufficient performance upper
bounds.

Assignment 6:
- 
To lean how to handle hashing collisions, I created programs that would handle both linear probing and quadratic probing to resolve hash collisions.
